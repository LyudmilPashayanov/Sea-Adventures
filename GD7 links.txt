I see that this is an matching app for depressed people, who are looking for a quick way to find comfort and get rid of their feeling of loneliness, by watching 5 seconds videos from people using this application.

If this application target audiance is going to be depressed people only, I would think that when someone who is feeling down wouldn't be able to record a 5 second video, which will cheer someone else who is also depressed.
